# 32-bit GCD Machine using Verilog HDL
**GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor. The GCD can be used in various fields such as cryptography and network security. This makes the GCD a fundamental algorithm in number theory, so a number of methods have been discovered to efficiently compute it. The main contribution of this project demonstrates simulation and validation of GCD of two positive integers using Verilog HDL in Xilinx ISE 14.7 based on Euclidâ€™s algorithm.**
